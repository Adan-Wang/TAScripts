# TA Scripts

Some scripts to make TA work faster during my Ph.D. degree.

The apply_watermark_xlsximport file applies watermark to a pdf file using an excel spreadsheet for names of the watermarks, this was done to improve security of exams.

The Compute_Total_xlsximport file computes the total score of a student on an exam using an excel score sheet, and puts this number in the front page. This has vastly accelerated the process of recording marks for some exams.
